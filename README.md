# Web FA2024 CSS Project

## Team Members: Ethan Epperson, Eva Reish, Madeline Mancini, Kyle Saunders

###  Main Goal: Create Symphony Website

Project Requirements:
- Your site must be at least 4 pages: landing page, schedule, FAQ, and contact/about (these could be split up or combined)
- Your site must have a navigation bar
- Your site must use best practices for accessibility (AAA color contrast, descriptive alt text, appropriate text sizes)
- Your site must use all provided copy and at least 2 provided images per page
- Your site must use at least 3 and no more than 8 colors
- Your site should not resemble the official site in any recognizable way (I would recommend not even looking at it to avoid the temptation)
